In Module 11, I gained several valuable insights into designing, validating, testing, and deploying new application features using modern backend development practices. The most important technical learning came from implementing password hashing and input validation using Pydantic. I understood how hashing protects user credentials and why raw passwords must never be stored. I also learned how Pydantic validators (migrated to V2-style field and model validators) enforce strict rules early, which prevents invalid data from ever reaching the database. This made me appreciate how much security and reliability can be achieved at the schema level alone.

Another major learning area was automated testing. I wrote both unit tests and integration tests for my new calculation feature. A key hurdle was a circular import issue and several Pydantic validation errors, which I fixed by restructuring imports and updating validators to the new Pydantic V2 format. Debugging those issues forced me to understand the relationships between models, schemas, CRUD functions, and the database layer more deeply.

A significant challenge involved Docker and GitHub Actions. I had to configure Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, create a Dockerfile for the FastAPI app, and set up GitHub Secrets so the CI pipeline could authenticate to Docker Hub. At first, the image push kept failing, but after correcting the workflow and secret variables, the pipeline ran successfully.

Overall, this module strengthened my understanding of secure backend development, automated testing, and CI/CD workflows. I now feel more confident building real-world, production-ready FastAPI applications.
